This policy detects hosts vulnerable to [[https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2118][CVE-2016-2118]] (commonly known as
[[http://badlock.org][Badlock]]) by checking if a known vulnerable package version is currently
installed. The remediation policy keeps =samba= at the =latest= version
available.

* Installation

This policy installs using a traditionally (but horribly written) [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] To
install simply clone this repository, and then run ~make install
MASTERFILES=</path/to/policy_root>~.

For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results raw :wrap EXAMPLE
make install MASTERFILES=/tmp/example-a10042
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mkdir -p /tmp/example-a10042/services/cfengine-CVE-2016-2118/cfengine-CVE-2016-2118
rsync -avz --exclude /home/nickanderson/vagrant/tmp/eia/CVE/masterfiles/services/cfengine-CVE-2016-2118/* /tmp/example-a10042/services/cfengine-CVE-2016-2118/

After installing the policy into your policy set you need to add it to inputs so
that it will be parsed.

If your running CFEngine =3.7.3=, =3.8.1= or greater. You can use the [[https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/master/reference-language-concepts-augments.html][augments
file]] to add it to inputs.

For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
      "inputs": [
          "services/cfengine-CVE-2016-2118/main.cf"
      ]
  }
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

** =inventory_CVE_2016_2118=
=inventory_CVE_2016_2118= is an autorun bundle, so if your running the
Masterfiles Policy Framework, you can simply define the =services_autorun=
class.

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
      "inputs": [
          "services/cfengine-CVE-2016-2118/main.cf"
      ],
      "classes": {
          "services_autorun": [ "any" ]
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

When the policy runs and detects a vulnerable host it emits a report and defines
the class =CVE_2016_2118=.

For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
R: Detected Vulnerability: CVE-2016-2118
#+END_EXAMPLE

CFEngine Enterprise users will see the Inventory Reporting interface in Mission
Portal augmented with a new =Vulnerable CVE(s)= attribute.

For example:

[[file:./media/vulnerable_cves_inventory_attribute.png]]

[[file:./media/inventory_report_vulnerable_cves.png]]

[[file:./media/inventory_report_vulnerable_cves_chart.png]]

[[file:./media/define_alert.png]]

[[file:./media/alert_status_vulnerable_hosts.png]]

** =remediate_CVE_2016_2118=
=remediate_CVE_2016_2118= is also an autorun bundle, but only when the
the =remediate_CVE_2016_2118= class is defined.

There are numerous ways you can flexibly express which hosts and during what
time periods automatic remediation is allowed.

If your running =3.7.3=, =3.8.1= or greater you can enable it for your entire
infrastructure by adding it to the [[https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/master/reference-language-concepts-augments.html][augments file]].

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
      "inputs": [
          "services/cfengine-CVE-2016-2118/main.cf"
      ],
      "classes": {
          "services_autorun": [ "any" ],
          "remediate_CVE_2016_2118": [ "any" ]
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

The policy looks for the list of packages that are known to be vulnerable in a
json data file named for the systems flavor as identified by =$(sys.flavor)=,
for example [[file:data/centos_6.json][=centos_6=]].
